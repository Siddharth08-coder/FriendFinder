A peer to peer social networking application which aims to bring people of same likes together.
Since we all are trapped in a pandemic, our social life has almost ceased
to exist.
Here comes in the Friend Finder App.
Only VITains will be allowed to use this app and the login to this app
would be done and authenticated through the official VIT email ID, so
you know it's a real person that you are talking to behind the other
screen.
On signing up, you will be given a personality test where your answers
will be stored in our database.
Then a list of people will appear sorted in the order of your match rate.
The higher the rating the more the visibility. You will also have an option
to just surf through all the possible accounts.
Each account from the list can be further viewed with a tap, and the bio
and pics of that person which he/she uploaded on our database will be
accessible.
You will also have the option to customise your bio and pictures.
Overall, you can find potential friends, dates and many more through our
application and be assured that you are communicating to a real person
behind the scenes.
